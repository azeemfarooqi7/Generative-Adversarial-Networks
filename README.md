# Generative-Adversarial-Networks
An implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data or images, utilizing the adversarial training process between a generator and a discriminator for realistic outputs.
# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This project implements Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data or images, leveraging the adversarial training process between a generator and a discriminator network.

## 📁 Files in the Repository

- `generative_adversarial_networks.py`: The main Python script that builds, trains, and tests the GAN model.
